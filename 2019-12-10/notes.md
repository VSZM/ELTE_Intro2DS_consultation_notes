## Assigment tips

- Download and take a look at the data
- Check the description of the data. This usually helps in deciding what kind of algorithm you need to use.
- Continuus feature prediction requires regression, while discrete variables can be classified. You can also do clustering on a discrete variable if you drop it. 
- There might be preprocessing steps that are easier to do in a text editor than python
- Import the data into a jupyter notebook
- Do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Do transformations and data massage as necessary. Handle missing values, clean data, transform string to numerical representations (One hot encoding or label encoding for example)
- Check data correlations, visualize your data
- Choose a simple model at first with default parameters. Later on you can experiment with parameter optimization and more complex models.
- Evaluate your model. Visualize it if possible.
- **COMMENT ALL THE STEPS YOU DO, EXPLAIN YOUR THOUGH PROCESS!**
- You can export your notebook to PDF in jupyter: File > Download as > PDF via LaTeX
- None of this stuff is groundbreaking, Google has all the answers :)
