## Suggested homework

Try out different clusterint algorithms on the Iris dataset. Try to correctly cluster the data without the class labels. 

1. Download iris dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
2. Visualize classes based on sepal and petal information in 2d
3. Drop the class label 
4. Clustering based on 4 metric attribute
5. Visualize the clustered classed based on sepal and petal information in 2d
6. Try it with different clustering algorithms and see which one is the most accurate
